## Testing

The intention was to use [taiko](https://taiko.gauge.org/) and [gauge](https://gauge.org/) to execute some automated e2e acceptance tests, but the file upload componenet either needs some reworking for taiko to be able to interact with it. It seems to be related to this [issue](https://github.com/getgauge/taiko/issues/979).
